# TheDungeon
Simple C++ Text Adventure

This is a pure C++ text adventure designed for the linux terminal. This will eventually have networking support so that two players can play in the same instance of the dungeon. There will be co-op exclusive quests only available when two people are playing, but the game will be fully playable single player as well.
